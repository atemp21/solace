Things I would do to improve this app given more time:

1. fix type errors in route.ts (not an expert with Drizzle. I was able to get it to work but not sure if it's the best way)
2. improve the search functionality to search on more fields
3. improve pagination to show total number of advocates and allow for choosing page size
4. debounce the search functionality to prevent too many requests
5. add loading states and error handling
6. add unit tests and integration tests
7. add sorting functionality
